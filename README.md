The main topic of research on energy flexibility in buildings focuses on optimizing the use of energy resources to enhance the adaptability of buildings to changing energy demands and supply conditions. Energy flexibility is about how buildings can respond to fluctuations in energy availability, prices, and grid demands by adjusting their energy consumption, storage, and generation.
